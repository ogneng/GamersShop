My first JavaScript and jQuery project in second year of study at FINKI.

How to open:
First download the whole project.
Then extract.
Go to WEB folder, and open html.html in browser.

This project is purely JavaScript and jQuary, it has 5 pages but only 2 have functionalities on them.

The first page is html.html or as called Naslovna. Theare are few types of products and can chose which type to be shown at a time, as loading the page first is NAJPRODAVANI. Also you can add prodcus to Omileni (Favourites) or in Koshnicka (Bucket) and also remove products from it. There is login and the button changes as you login or logout. There is not implemented any requiretment for it.
